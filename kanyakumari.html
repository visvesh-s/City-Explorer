                Thiruvalluvar Statue

                Thiruvalluvar Statue
                The Thiruvalluvar Statue has a height of 29 metres (95 feet) and stands upon a 11.5-metre (38 ft) rock
                that represents the 38 chapters of "virtue" in the Thirukkural. The statue standing on the rock
                represents "wealth" and "pleasures", signifying that wealth and love be earned and enjoyed on the
                foundation of solid virtue.The combined height of the statue and pedestal is 133 ft (40.5 m),
                denoting the 133 chapters in the Thirukkural. It has a total weight of 7000 tons. The statue, with its
                slight bend around the waist, is reminiscent of a dancing pose of the ancient Indian deities like
                Nataraja. It was sculpted by the Indian sculptor V. Ganapati Sthapati, who also created the Iraivan
                Temple. Its opening ceremony was on 1 January 2000. The monument was hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami on
                26 December 2004.but stood unaffected. The statue is designed to survive earthquakes of unexpected
                magnitudes, such as magnitude 6 on the Richter Scale occurring within 100 kilometres. This is far beyond
                that of any event recorded in the regional history. During maintenance work, as well as during rough
                sea, entry is restricted for tourists.
